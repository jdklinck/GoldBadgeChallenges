If you complete three before the deadline then you are to continue building out these challenges.

Requirements:
**A minimum of three (3) Console Applications built based on prompts linked above
**All applications will be built in one single solution
**Each project's architecture should include an assembly each for the ProgramUI, Repository, and Unit Tests
**A Unit Test assembly for each challenge with test coverage for all repository functionality
	*Tests for the UI (Console Application) are not required but are highly encouraged
**Assemblies should have a consistent naming convention that helps identify related groups
	*Examples:
	*ChallengeOne.Console, ChallengeOne.Repository, etc
	*Badges.Console, Badges.Repository, etc.
**No extra white space, proper naming convention of variables and classes
**A README attached to the project that documents the project
**Regular use of git while working through the project

Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.

The Menu Items:
A meal number, so customers can say "I'll have the #5"
A meal name

A price

Your Task:
Create a Menu Class with properties, constructors, and fields.
Create a MenuRepository Class that has methods needed.
Create a Test Class for your repository methods. (You don't need to test your constructors or objects, just your methods)
Create a Program file that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.
